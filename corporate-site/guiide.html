                        <p>Our (and other firms) recent polling suggest 80% of defined contribution pension savers feel they get little to no help on pension planning, from where they would expect to turn first, i.e. their employer, trustees or provider.</p>
                        <p>That was our users main reason for seeking the help that we provide.</p>

                    <h2 class="mb-4">So what does Guiide do?</h2>
                    <p>Put simply, there are plenty of tools which tell people if they take X each year, earn Y returns their pots will last for Z years. For almost everyone these offer no practical help.</p>
                    <p>Nearly everyone has other income or savings to put towards retirement, State Pensions, Final Salary pensions, ISA savings and part time work for example. Some are taxable, some are not.</p>
                    <p>Our tool is the only free to use fully holistic calculator that can be used directly that answers the question savers actually want answered, i.e. how do I use everything I have to get the after tax income I want in retirement?</p>

                        <p>I'm a professional trustee and pensions lawyer. This is the best software I have seen on the internet to help people understand their financial position with regard to pensions and investments. It is far superior to anything being provided by insurance companies and IFAs.</p>

                        <p>Simple to use and, if I’d known about it sooner, I’d have saved hours producing a spreadsheet to do the same thing! I particularly like the variable “what if” scenarios which enable you to test your future projection against adverse circumstances.</p>
