                    <p>Our research suggests around 80% of schemes simply direct members to unbiased or MoneyHelper, to find this advice on their own, rather than provider a trusted adviser, or panel, directly.</p>
                    <p>There is a clear risk that members with a potentially life changing sized transfer value will receive poor advice when needing to find their own, be overcharged, or in the worse case scenario, fall victim to a scam.</p>

                    <h2 class="mb-4">So how does Guiide DB help?</h2>
                    <p>Put simply, rather than signposting DB members to find their own advice. signposting to Guiide DB provides members with an education journey on the advice process. It clearly sets out the risks involved in a transfer and the FCAs view on who a transfer is highly unlikely to be suitable for.</p>
                    <p>After considering these views against their own circumstances, highlighted within our journey, they can decide to continue with transfer advice, or simply seek at retirement advice using their existing benefits.</p>
                    <p>A safe harbour to advice is then provided with a panel of transfer specialists and general retirement advisers, with members shown the appropriate panel. These advisers are vetted and their advice monitored via our specialist advice oversight advisers and governance committee (independently chaired by Andrew Warwick-Thompson, former director of regulation at the Pensions Regulator).</p>

                    <h2 class="mb-4">How can your DB members benefit?</h2>
                    <p>Our free to use journey can be signposted by any size scheme. Rather than (or alongside) signposting to unbiased our journey is signposted as an option to members on their transfer value communications.</p>
                    <p>Members are provided with a unique login code and can choose to use our journey at no cost. If advice is taken from an adviser on our panel, a consistent referral fee is paid by the adviser to us, regardless of the outcome of the advice. Members are never charged more by an adviser than if they found them directly.</p>
                    <h3 class="mt-4 mb-3">Our paid model</h3>
                    <p>For schemes who, on the advice of their legal advisers, do not wish for us to use a referral model, or for those schemes who wish to contribute towards the cost, a paid version is also available. This is charged at Â£250 per login code used.</p>
                    <p>This model has the additional benefit of reduced advice fees for the member as any referral fee is reduced from the member charge.</p>

                        <p>We believe our education and guidance journey, overlaid with an independently monitored adviser panel materially raises the bar on the current default option for DB scheme members. It provides a safe harbour to high quality advice and removes the every rising potential for scams at potentially one of the most vulnerable times for members, after requesting a transfer.</p>
